# Backend Challenge :rocket:
Welcome to the coding challenge :wave:

## Your challenge

### User Story
As someone who likes games, I want to have a little game which I can play with a friend by taking turns at the keyboard, so that we can amuse ourselves.

### Description
You have a free hand here: what game you choose, what programming language you choose, and how the users interface with the game (CLI, a webpage, etc) is all up to you. Our strong suggestion: Keep it simple. Some games you might consider are tic-tac-toe, connect 4, Hangman, rock-paper-scissors - we're not looking for Doom or Minecraft here.

We don't expect you to spend too much of your free time on this project - aim for maximum 2 hours.

After you submit your pull request, our team will review it within two working days. You are invited to participate in the discussion: we want you to see how it would be to work with us! :raised_hands:

### Requirements
* Create a feature branch
* Create a simple two-player game which the players can play by taking turns at the keyboard
* After a user has made a move, display the current state of the game
* Offer a way to start a new game
* Add a section to the README.md explaining how we can run the project
* Also add an explanation of (or link to) the rules of the game, in case it's one we don't know
* Create your pull request on github and let us know you're finished via email!

### What we explicitly don't care about
* This is not a frontend task. You do not need to make this pretty in any form
* You don't need to check the users' input for validity; in this case, we'll assume they only input valid moves
* You don't need to check whether a move has won the game; we'll also assume they can tell that from the output

### Hints
* Commit often and write meaningful commit messages
* If you are using a framework, please do the framework commits separate from your own code
* Consider extensibility. We might need to add a feature later
* Be prepared to walk us through the thought process of how you organized and executed the challenge

### Questions?
In case there is anything unclear about what this challenge is about, what the scope is, what our expectations are, feel free to reach out to us! cynthia.mattingly@celebrate.company

This is not just a figure of speech but a serious offer :smiley:

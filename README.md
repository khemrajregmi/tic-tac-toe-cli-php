## Your challenge

### User Story
As someone who likes games, I want to have a little game which I can play with a friend by taking turns at the keyboard, so that we can amuse ourselves.

### Description
We have slightly different expectations depending on what the level is of the position you are applying for - you'll find explicit directions in the README that applies to you.

### Questions?
In case there is anything unclear about what this challenge is about, what the scope is, what our expectations are, feel free to reach out to us! sebastian.thoss@celebrate.company

This is not just a figure of speech but a serious offer :smiley:
